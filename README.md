## MCIIF
This is the source code for **'Robust multi-view clustering via inter-and-intra-view low rank fusion'** Neurocomputing 2020.

## Matlab R2016a
Use **run.m** to run. Our model MCIIF is packed as a function in **mciif.m**. <br>
**code_coregspectral** is a popular package released by the authors of *Coregularized multiview spectral clustering (NIPS 2011)*. <br>
We have detailly explain the codes by annotations, check it out!

## Data
